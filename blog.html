            <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px;"> I have been recently studying SQL and have completed a university assignment in which I
                was tasked with creating, populating and overall using SQL to maniplate data within a database. It was quite easy to understand
                and I plan on using SQL in later personal/university projects. I used phpMyAdmin to manage the SQL server.

            <p style="color: white; font-size: 18px;"> This week I took on a project that implemented databases. The project was coded in Java,
                and for the database aspect I used mySQL server & SQL Workbench. The project itself was quite simple as it performed user validation 
                to check whether the user attempting to login was a registered user or not, if the latter, the user was able to sign up with their own
                unique sign in credentials. Overall, I would say I am satisfied with the outcome of the program, as it is my first time working with
                databases. <a href="https://github.com/Eric-Nobrega/databaseProject"> Source Code Available Here</a>
